The mission of the University of Belize Environmental Research Institute (UB-ERI) is to advance environmental science and support a culture of evidence-based decision-making relevant to sustainable development.
In support of this mission, one of our active projects is a long-term coral reef monitoring project at Turneffe Atoll Marine Reserve. This project began in 2010 using the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System Synoptic Monitoring Program (MBRS SMP), with sampling at the reef occurring every summer. In 2021 and 2023, further data were collected, using the Atlantic and Gulf Rapid Reef Assessment (AGRRA) protocols, in collaboration with the Healthy Reefs Initiative. These methods were very similar, and the shift was made as MBRS SMP was being phased out in Belize, and AGRRA was being introduced to the National Coral Reef Monitoring Network (NCRMN).
Coral reefs are major centres of biodiversity in Belize. They host many diverse marine species and provide ecosystem services to coastal communities. By monitoring our coral reefs, we are able to assess how the reefs are changing over time. We will be able to monitor and predict the potential impact of climate and environmental changes, as well as human activities, on coral reef health and biodiversity.
Here, we present a variety of data visualizations made using our long-term monitoring data. Use, reuse, and interpretation of this monitoring data supports the protection and understanding of Turneffe Atoll Marine Reserve, and assists with informed decision-making and management strategies for the conservation of this crucial ecosystem.
