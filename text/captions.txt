Methodology is MBRS SMP prior to 2021, and AGRRA in 2021 and beyond, leading to potential differences in results based on methodology. Generated by University of Belize Environmental Research Institute, on the Explore TAMR shiny app.
Plots include overall observations of bleached versus non-bleached coral, type of bleaching observed in bleached coral, overall observations of diseased versus non-diseased coral, and type of disease observed in diseased coral. 
The higher dotted line (at 7.5cm) displays the minumum accepted value of fish length for MBRS years (representing fish 5-10cm), and the lower dotted line (at 2.5cm) displays the minumum accepted value of fish length for AGRRA years (representing fish 0-5cm). 
Methodology is MBRS SMP prior to 2021, and AGRRA in 2021 and beyond, leading to potential differences in results based on methodology. Most critically here is the size of the fish list (species which could be recorded by observers) was 66 in MBRS years, and 72 in AGRRA years.

Only site occurrences with 8 transects worth of data are included in the visualization, to avoid uneven sampling effort in the figure.
